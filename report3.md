## This Week's Topic: Conversion and Transaction Analysis

### Testing Status

As of this morning, split (A/B) testing has gone live. The first experiment measures the impact additional product copy and the PYT ordering sequence has on your website’s sales performance. Our goal is to dramatically increase the conversion rate (and revenue) from first-impression visitors.

### Targeting “High Potential” Visitors

It's normal (and only logical) for any e-Commerce business to find repeat visitors out-performing new visitors. By continuation of that concept, we also expect that first-time visitors will always appear to be less valuable than repeat visitors.

However, it is the quality and clarity of the first-time visitor's experience that determines the likelihood he or she chooses to return and/or reorder. 

Our sights are set firmly on improving new visitor conversion rates. Existing customers are unlikely to be influenced by marketing copy or improved product explanations as they have already bought and decided to buy again. There isn't anything they don't already understand insofar as it influences their buying behavior. 

That said, remarketing campaigns designed to reach out to bought-once-and-never-returned customers are a major future consideration! More on this below.

In short: the big lever on retail revenue boost depends on converting more buyers and return visitors from Milk Stork's enormous audience of single-session visitors. 

### Not All Data Is Present

In the interest of brevity and clarity, we have opted to include data samples of only the most critical insights. This analysis involves large data sets collected with multiple tools over a several week period. Including every scrap of data would turn this report into a database.

Some sets of conclusions will be given in list format without supporting data. If you become skeptical of any particular conclusion, please feel free to ask us for supporting evidence and we will be happy to elaborate and/or clarify. 

As always, we're careful to highlight the difference between data-driven analysis and if-this-then-maybe-that hypotheses. 

## Table Formatting Check

You must always ensure that table formatting is done as well as possible. If your tables aren't in tip-top shape, then how can you call yourself a true master of the grid?

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">First column **fields**</td>
<td markdown="span">Some descriptive text. This is a markdown link to [Google](http://google.com). Or see [some link][mydoc_tags].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">Second column **fields**</td>
<td markdown="span">Some more descriptive text.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you look closely you'll see that there are some major things in that thing.
